# Weather Dashboard

## Made by Vincent Ingrassia

This application allows the user to enter in a city name and recive the weather forecast for the current date, and the next 4 days. This is done
through two public APIs, the second one is the weather app, which can only get weather locations based on geographical cordinates. The first is an API that gets the geographical cordinates of a city. Combining these two allows the user to check the weather of a city. It also saves past searches, to allow the user to click on one to quickly re-check the weather. Admittly I could not get that functionality to consistantly work.
